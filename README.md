During the bootcamp at </Salt> we were given the challange to individually create a full stack application from scratch.
We got to choose our projects freely.
This app is what I built during that day.
It's an early-stage app for automating podcast creaton utilising external AI technologies to create audio and post summery based on user input.

##API resources
this app uses two external APIs for the conversions. You will need to create a developer account with both and save your keys into a local -env-file in the following format in order to access them. (OBS. dont include the "-marks)

ONEAI_API_KEY="YOUR-KEY-HERE"

CLOUD_KEY="YOUR-KEY-HERE"

###links to external API's

## Set-up
run npm install in both server and client folders. 
use npm start in both to start the dev server and the app

ENJOY!
